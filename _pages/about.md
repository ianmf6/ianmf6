I am **Ian Marrero,** a technology enthusiast, who enjoys playing with technology and figuring stuff out. I am a **Cyber Security Engineer** and have a M.S. in Cybersecurity Technology. I use this blog to share my professional and personal experience in cybersecurity, system administration, and a way to keep notes of important things I have learned or came across that you might find interesting too.
