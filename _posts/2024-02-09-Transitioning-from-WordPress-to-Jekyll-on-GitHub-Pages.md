I recently embarked on a tech journey, moving my blog from WordPress hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet to using Jekyll on GitHub Pages. This wasn't just a leap from one platform to another; it was a step towards simplification and efficiency after facing a significant hiccup.

### The Original Setup with WordPress and Digital Ocean

Initially, my blog lived on WordPress, running on a Digital Ocean droplet. For those unfamiliar, WordPress is quite the powerhouse for website creation, offering a plethora of plugins and themes. My setup on a Digital Ocean droplet, a cloud-based virtual server, was pretty solid, with security updates and WordPress patches happening automatically. It was a robust setup, ensuring everything was up-to-date and secure without much manual intervention.

### Why GitHub Pages and Jekyll Caught My Eye

Then, I discovered GitHub Pages and Jekyll. GitHub Pages offers a straightforward approach to hosting websites directly from a GitHub repository, eliminating the complexity of databases and server management. Jekyll, a static site generator, transforms plain text into static websites and blogs. This combination promised a hassle-free hosting solution, focusing on content rather than maintenance.

### The Catalyst for Change: A System Failure

The motivation to switch was a system failure following a WordPress plugin update. My website suddenly became unresponsive, requiring a deep dive into troubleshooting. Considering the potential time sink, I opted for a simpler, more manageable solution.

### Migrating Content: A Lesson in Backups

The migration was made possible by diligent backup practices. Using these backups, I was able to transfer my content to the new platform. This process highlighted the importance of regular backups and testing them to ensure they can be relied upon in emergencies.

### A New Beginning on GitHub Pages

To our visitors, welcome to the revamped blog. This migration signifies more than just a change of platforms; it represents a shift towards a more streamlined and focused blogging experience. Here's to a future where we can share insights without the overhead of complex site management.

Thank you for joining me on this new path.
