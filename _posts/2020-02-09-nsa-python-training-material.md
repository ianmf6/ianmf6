A brave individual (@chris\_swenson) placed a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request for NSA’s Python training materials. The course is a text-only document that contains 2 weeks / 8 hour days training to become proficient in Python. The course in unclassified, which allows everyone including those with security clearances to read the document and practice their coding skills.
