Last month, I had the great opportunity to be recognized with Department of Commerce Bronze Medal. The Bronze Medal is the highest award presented by the head or secretarial officer of a bureau under the Department of Commerce, for superior performance.

Special thanks goes to those who helped me achieved this moment, especially to C. Allen, N. Patel., “T”, C. Nguyen, and S. Lee. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to demonstrate my expertise and knowledge towards the accomplishment of our mission. It has been an honor.
