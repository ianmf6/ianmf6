Today, I close another chapter in my life. After 4 years working for the US Census Bureau, I leave in search of a new and more challenging adventure in an area that interests me the most. I have learned a lot in those 4 years: from system administration to information security.

Thanks to everyone who took their time and patience to mentor me; and those who took their time to listen to me as I shared my knowledge and experiences with them. I hope I left a *fingerprint* in the team. I am really going to miss every single one of you. Good luck in your journey as Census 2020 comes closer each day.

See you all around.
