I have started learning additional offensive techniques and decided to put them to the test on [HackTheBox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). The first machine I tackled was Access. It is simple and not very complex. It has multiple ways of pwning root and I have written a writeup explaining on how to accomplish it. Because the machine is Active, I have password-protected the PDF file until the machine is retired.

If you ever need get stuck in any machine, you could always post questions in the forums @ [HackTheBox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) or join their Discord channel [Official Hack The Box Discord](https://discord.gg/xDXMmjU).

If you read the document, feel free to provide some input. It will be appreciated.
