Often I see posts on Reddit asking “Where do you get your news about cybersecurity from?”. There are many places to get your news from and it varies depending on what kind of information your are searching for. There is digital forensics, network defender, application security, threat hunting, and more. I have created a list of resources I follow to stay updated about whats going on.

Feel free to share it with others or submit links that you think should be included in the list.
