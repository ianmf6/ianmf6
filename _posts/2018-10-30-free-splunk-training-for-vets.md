I just came across a great resource for US Veterans that can help them start or enhance their career cybersecurity. Splunk offers free their Fundamentals training to all US Veterans for free. It will not make you a pro at Splunk but it is a good resource to familiarize yourself with the tool. To validate your veteran status, you must have a USAA account or upload your DD-214.

You can signup or find out more about the program [Here](http://workplus.splunk.com/veterans).
